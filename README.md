This project was initially created in 2015 by **@byt3bl33d3r**. In 2019 **@mpgn_x64** started maintaining the project. Five years and a lot of  additions later, he retired from maintaining the project. Like many other contributer we (NeffIsBack, Marshall-Hallenbeck and zblurx) started working on new features, bugfixes and helped maintaining CME. With the end of mpgn's maintainer role, we decided to maintain the project together as an full open source project.
